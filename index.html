    I like blogs. Here are some of them (or posts) I found of particular value, in no particular order. <br><br>

    My Academic CV for lulz:<br>
    Computer Science, BA, 2015-2016, University of Warsaw - passed the first semester by the skin of my teeth (looking at you, WPF). Dropped out after the first year.<br>
    Philosophy, BA, 2016-2019, University of Warsaw - graduated with the grade "very good", thesis on how a ban on abortion could be regarded as eugenics.<br>
    Philosophy, Erasmus+ programme, 09.2018-12.2018, University of Aberdeen - got an A in each of the courses taken, simultanously hitting the rock bottom and losing sanity short of psychosis.<br>
    Philosophy, CEEPUS programme, 01.2019-02.2019, University of Split - did nothing for a month.<br>
    Philosophy (MISH), MA, 2019-2021, University of Warsaw - I was the last one on the admitted list. I passed the first semester in Cognitive Science and a year and a half in Philosophy. Didn't have it in me to finish the degree.<br>
    Compliance and AML Analyst, post-graduate, 2021-2022, Kozminski University - "good +" grade, useless degree.<br>
    Big Data, post-graduate, 2022-2023 (graduated in 2024), Warsaw University of Technology - excellent grade (undeserved). The effort it took was immense, even though the course wasn't extremely difficult.<br>
