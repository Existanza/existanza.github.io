    I was born in the desert, May 17. <br>
    <br>
    Diagnosed with depression in 2014. <br>
    <br>
    I've been on a range of medications, I also underwent psychotherapy (twice).
    <br>
    I believe that the people suffering from mental illnesses have been particularly harmed by the stigmatization of those issues. <br>
    <br>
    Hence, I'm resolved to be as informative on the topic as possible, hoping it will be of value to those who are suffering. <br>
    <br>
    By no means am I a professional, my advice should not be treated as medical, finally, I shall confine myself to the issue of depression. <br>
